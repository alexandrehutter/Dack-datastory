<p>In this next part, we will talk about the processing that we had to apply to our datasets to get insights ...

  What is the global evolution of the cultivated surface per country from 1995 to 2007?
  What is the area lost of savanna, shrubland, grassland and forest per country per year?
  Do we see a correlation between the area lost by ecosystems and the area gain by agriculture?
  For each selected crop, sojabean, banana, wheat, rice and palm oil, what pourcentage of the total cultivated area do they represent?
  If there is a correlation between an increase in area cultivated and area lost from all the ecosystems, what would be approximatively the area lost because of the selected crops in particular?
  Are sojabean, banana, wheat, rice and palm oil meant for exportation and/or importation for each country over the years? Check more precisely for different economical segments and regions.
  How can we identify short term food trends and what is its impact on the global and country wise area loss?
