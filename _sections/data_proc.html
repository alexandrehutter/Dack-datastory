<p>The FAOSTAT data sets are broad in information and a first important part of our investigation was to find the appropriate data sets to precisly answer our problematic. We use 4 data sets from FAOSTAT and one from web scrapping on the Wikipedia article "List of countries and dependencies by area". The 4 data sets give informations by year and areas. Areas can be at different scales, from countries to continents, going to economical segments. They are the following:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Data on crops, which we reduced to 2 elements of informations, the area harvested and the production quantity for each foodstuff or categories of products.</li>
<li>Data on export and import, with two different parts, the quantity of products and the monetary value of those exchanges.</li>
<li>Data on burnt savannas surfaces, for which we only keep the main categories of biomes,&nbsp;Savana, Shrubland and Grassland.</li>
<li>Data on burnt forests surfaces, really similar to the data set on savannas.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>We will join the two last ones to form a "Biomes" data set that we can compare to the "Area of Crops" one. We also add a column corresponding to the percentage that a given area, loss of biome or gain of cultivated surface, represents in the total surface of a country. To answer questions about link between elements, we calculate a lot of correlations that we present in the analysis.</p>
