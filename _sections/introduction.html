<p>7.7 billion people around the world in 2019 and still no viable solution to provide food to everyone! The numbers don't lie and the situation is not getting any better.</p>
<p>As for now cultivable surface expansion has been the only realistic solution but let's be honest, with the raising awarness on climate change and environment, very few people believe that intensive agriculture would work on the long run. With this "guide" on how agriculture is currently shaping the surface of the world, we would like to provide a line of thoughts on the destructive foodstuffs and inversly the products that would deserve our attention to shape the future of our alimentation.</p>
<p>Our investigation is based on data sets from FAOSTAT, published by the United Nation and related to food and agriculture. It gives us a really broad set of informations to answer to our problematic. The investigation will first focus on the kind of environment that are being impinged on to favor intensive agriculture. Subsequently, the destructive impact of certain foodstuffs, correlating with international trade flows will be investigated. Going one step further, we endeavor at providing an exhaustive visualization of the world under growing food reshaping pressure. Key features will be surface evolution across time and space, selected crops impact as well as involved parties and areas in the food economy. We would particularly like to tackel with both social awareness and self consciousness concerns.</p>

<p>Hence, we will try to answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What is the global evolution of the occupation of the surface per country between cultivated areas and natural biomes?&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is agriculture directly linked to the loss of our ecosystems?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is there a link between the place of agriculture in the economy of a country and its economic development?&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Looking at the "desctructive" impact of the foodstuffs on ecosystems and their rentability both spacial and economic, can we recommand a prefered product for a certain country?&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
