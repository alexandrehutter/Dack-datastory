<p>With 7.7 billion people around the world in 2019, food demand outbreak has raised serious concerns regarding productive agricultural land availability. 
  As for now cultivable surface expansion has been the only real solution, this project aims at providing insights on how this problematic is currently shaping the world’s surface as we know it.
  Investigation will first focus on the kind of environment that are being impinged on. Moving on to the “destructive” impact of certain foodstuffs and diet trends,
  correlating with international trade flows. This study relies on FAOSTAT data set from the United Nation, helping us in the process.

  We endeavor at providing an exhaustive visualization of the world under growing food reshaping pressure. Key features will be surface evolution across time and space,
  selected crops impact as well as involved parties and areas. Tackling all of the above with both social awareness and self consciousness concerns.</p>
