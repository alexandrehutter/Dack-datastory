<p>7.7 billion people around the world in 2019 and still no viable solution to provide food to everyone! The numbers don't lie and the situation is not getting any better.
  As for now cultivable surface expansion has been the only realistic solution but let's be honest, with the raising awarness on climate change and environment, very few people believe that intensive agriculture would work on the long run.
  With this "guide" on how agriculture is currently shaping the surface of the world, we would like to provide a line of thoughts on the destructive foodstuffs and inversly the products that would deserve our attention to shape our future.

  The investigation will first focus on the kind of environment that are being impinged on. Moving on to the “destructive” impact of certain foodstuffs and diet trends,
  correlating with international trade flows. This study relies on FAOSTAT data set from the United Nation.

  We endeavor at providing an exhaustive visualization of the world under growing food reshaping pressure. Key features will be surface evolution across time and space,
  selected crops impact as well as involved parties and areas. Tackling all of the above with both social awareness and self consciousness concerns.</p>
