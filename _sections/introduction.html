<p>7.7 billion people around the world in 2019 and still no viable solution to provide food to everyone!&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for now, intensive agriculture expansion has been the only realistic solution, but let's be honest, with the raising awarness on climate change and environment, very few people believe that it is a viable solution on the long term. With this "guide" on how agriculture is currently shaping the surface of the world, we would like to provide a line of thoughts on the destructive foodstuffs and inversly the products that would deserve our attention to reshape the future of our alimentation.</p>
<p>Our investigation is based on data sets from FAOSTAT, published by the United Nation and related to food and agriculture. It gives us a really broad set of informations to answer to our problematic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First of all, we endeavor at providing an exhaustive visualization of the world under growing food reshaping pressure by presenting global tendancies. Subsequently, the impact of intensive exportation on biomes area loss is investigated in order to see if agriculture directly impinged on natural biomes and if some foodstuffs can be classified as &ldquo;destructive&rdquo; for the environment. Going one step further, we established an indice that tackels with both social and environmental awareness concerns to advice countries on which food to grow.</p>
<p>Hence, we will try to answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the global evolution of the production quantity per country from 1995 to 2007?</li>
<li>What is the area lost of savanna, shrubland, grassland and forest per country over a year?</li>
<li>Do we see a correlation between the area lost by ecosystems and exportation?</li>
<li>Can we find an indice to rank foodstuffs and advice countries on how to extend agriculture in a more sustainable way?</li>
</ul>
